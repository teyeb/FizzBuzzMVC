# FizzBuzzMVC
This projects allows the users to enter an integer (Fizz) and another (Buzz), then prints all numbers from 1-100, but replaces values divisible by both Fiz and Buzz as "FizzBuzz", while replacing those only divisible by Fizz and "Fizz", and those divisible by Buzz as "Buzz". All other values are printed as usual.
